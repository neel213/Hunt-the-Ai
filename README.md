Hunt the Al, is a social Turing Test-style game with a fun twist:

4 human players + 1 Al chatbot

A 3-minute group chat in Hinglish (Hindi + English) on relatable topics using WhatsApp-style language

Players then had just 15 seconds to vote who they thought was the Al

Correct guesses = 1 point to each player

The aim? To test both the subtlety of Al and the intuitiveness of human judgment - all while keeping the energy light, competitive, and engaging.

This experience taught me the importance of:

User engagement design
Gamification in tech

Team coordination under pressure

Hosting and communication in a live setting

It was both an honor and a high-energy challenge to deliver something innovative and memorable.

Here's to more such initiatives that merge tech, creativity, and human behavior!
